# Gordon Ramsay Bot

Food critique via Gordon Ramsay (in gif or meme form)

# Getting Started

Gordon Ramsay inspired me to make this bot with his recipe critiques on Twitter: [Link](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/twitter-gordon-ramsay-insults#)


Some of them are kind of harsh though... :(

Send a photo or text to the bot and have your recipe personally critiqued by Gordon Ramsay (in GIF form)

The endpoints for this Flask app reside in `app.py`. Supporting modules reside in the main app directory. Food classes are in the `food_items` folder. The bot is
in development mode on Facebook so unfortunately people other than page admins can interact with it. But I included a demo for show!
